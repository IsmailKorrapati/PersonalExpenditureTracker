# PersonalExpenditureTracker
Build a command-line expense tracker that lets usersâ€™ input, categorize, and track daily expenses. The twist would be to include an efficient searching and sorting feature.
Key Features:
->	Add Expenses: Let users add expense details (e.g., amount, category, date).
->	View Expenses: Display all expenses, with options to filter by category or date.
->	Search Feature: Implement a search functionality for a specific expense or expenses within a certain date range (binary search or hash map can be used).
->	Sort Feature: Sort expenses by amount or date using sorting algorithms (merge sort or quicksort).
->	Budget Alerts: Set a budget, and if expenses exceed the limit, trigger an alert.
