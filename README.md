# PersonalExpenditureTracker
Build a command-line expense tracker that lets usersâ€™ input, categorize, and track daily expenses. The twist would be to include an efficient searching and sorting feature.

Key Features:
-	Add Expenses: Let users add expense details (e.g., amount, category).
-	View Expenses: Display all expenses, with options to filter by category.
-	Search Feature: Implement a search functionality for a specific category.
-	Sort Feature: Sort expenses by amount using sorting algorithms (merge sort).
